1. Create a file named components/card-list/card-list.component.jsx.
This can be card-list.jsx or index.jsx as per our penchant.

2. Every custom component should have its name in Pascal case.

3. Create a component CardList extending Component, add a render method
and export it as default (?).

4. Import this in AppClassComponent without {} (?).

5. When returning from a component make sure to return only 1 html component.
