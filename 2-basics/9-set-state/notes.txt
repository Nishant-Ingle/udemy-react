1. Component is not re-rendered is the original object doesn't change.
e.g. if a field from the object changes then don't re-render
even if variable points to a new object (using something like Object.assign).

2. Use setState method to update the fields in local state.
Point to note: variable name is state, if it was state2 then there won't
be any setState2.

3. Re-rendering happens when react sees that state object is a different
object in memory.
