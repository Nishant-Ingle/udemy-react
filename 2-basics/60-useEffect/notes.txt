1. useEffect(callback, values): callback is called whenever values is
initialized or changes.

2. To call a function only once pass the value as [].

3. If any state field changes there we are calculating filteredMonsters again
which is inefficient.

4. To get around this we introduce another effect which re-calculates
filteredMonsters and update state only when monsters or searchField changes.
