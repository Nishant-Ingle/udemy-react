1. The code returned from render method is not html.
Each tag represents a component in JSX.
e.g. div represent div component having logical mapping to html div.

2. That's why we use className instead of class keyword in this html like jsx as all
js rules apply here & class is a protected keyword.

3. Like onClick, we can have onChange property on jsx components that take an event
as parameter of a fat arrow function.
