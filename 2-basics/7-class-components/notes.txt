1. In index.js, we are passing the component to be 'rendered'.
2. This can be a class component or a function component.
3. Function component as the name suggests, is a function that
return HTML (specifically JSX).
4. Class components extends Component class react library
and the render method returns the same JSX.
See AppClassComponent.js.
