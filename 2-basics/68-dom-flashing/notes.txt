1. Painting refers to (re-)rendering.
2. Whenever a new component is added to a page entire page reflows
which is not much expensive though considered as painting.
e.g. empty h1 suddenly given height thus shifting other components.

3. React dev tools -> rendering -> enable paint flashing highlights components
that are re-painted.
