1. In a loop, react needs 'key' attribute in topmost
html tag for optimization of updating & re-rendering components.

e.g. if one h1 changes only that is re-rendered and not all h1s, it is 
found using key attribute by react.

2. 'key' is not shown in final html though react tracks it.

3. Adding key removes the warning from console.
